lright ‚Äî based on your latest QSPI_Master code (Mode‚ÄØ0 only, continuous level-trigger, 8‚Äëbit aligned, MSB‚Äëfirst) and our previous iterations, here‚Äôs the full list of remaining issues in the context of your defined constraints.



‚úÖ Already Resolved

MSB-first bit order in all modes.
CPOL honoured in assign sclk.
transmit_count correctly reset on reset and at end of transaction in all modes.
Lane indexing consistent across write/read.
transaction_done set consistently in FINISH for all modes.
Continuous ‚Äústream‚Äù mode per your requirement (no rising-edge detect).
No out-of-bounds indexing for DATA_WIDTH=8.


‚ö† Remaining / Context-Specific Issues

1. Hardcoded Dual/Quad stop values

You hardcoded:


if (sel_mode == 2'b01 && transmit_count == 1) ...
if (sel_mode == 2'b10 && transmit_count == 3) ...

This only works for:


DATA_WIDTH divisible evenly by lane width.
Exactly one byte per transaction.

It‚Äôs fine for your case (N25Q032A, 8‚Äëbit aligned), but dangerous if:


You later implement multi-byte burst per trigger.
You change DATA_WIDTH.

Risk: Silent truncation or extra cycles if you change lengths later.



2. Counter width still int

int is 32‚Äëbit signed ‚Äî fine for simulation, but overkill for synthesis.
Most FPGA tools will optimise it away, but good style is:


logic [
c
l
o
g
2
(
D
A
T
A
W
I
D
T
H
)
:

;
l

g
i
c
[
clog2(CLOCK_DIVIDER):0] clk_count;

This prevents mismatches if you parameterise DATA_WIDTH later.



3. CPHA parameter unused

You list CPHA but ignore it entirely. This is okay for Mode‚ÄØ0, but:


If you ever accidentally set CPHA != 0, behaviour will be wrong.
If CPHA is fixed, remove it from the port list to avoid misleading other users of the module.


4. Simultaneous Reset and Continuous Mode edge case

You reset transmit_count and data_buffer on reset and re‚Äëinit them in TRANSMISSION stop branches, but:


If asynchronous reset happens during TRANSMISSION, CS will go high immediately and release the bus without finishing data (normal for reset).
In continuous level‚Äëtrigger mode, as soon as reset deasserts, FSM will restart if trigger is still high ‚Äî may restart mid‚Äëbyte pattern.
This is only a problem if your higher-level code doesn‚Äôt guarantee reset masks trigger.


5. Bus direction management

Your read blocks set:


enable_io <= 4'b0010; // or 0000, or {4{1'b0}}

This tri-states output lanes during reads ‚Äî correct ‚Äî but remember:


In real hardware, turnaround cycles might be required when switching direction (especially in Quad/Dual).
If you expand to real flash protocol, you‚Äôll need a turnaround phase between last write cycle and first read cycle.


6. High‚ÄëZ and uninitialised IO behaviour at sim start

At sim time 0, enable_io is 0 from reset logic ‚Äî that‚Äôs good ‚Äî but in some tools, IO nets can show X‚Äôs if uninitialised slaves drive them in testbench.



üßæ Summary Table

Issue	Impact (for your constraints)	Fix Priority
Hardcoded Dual/Quad stop counts	Fine now, brittle if expand	Low
int counter widths	No functional bug	Low
CPHA unused	No functional bug now	Low
Reset + continuous mode restart early	Only in async reset mid-txn	Low
Missing turnaround cycles	Only in real device protocol	Future
High‚ÄëZ startup conditions	Only sim output aesthetics	Info


üöÄ Bottom line for your defined N25Q032A scope:

For Mode‚ÄØ0, 8‚Äëbit aligned, single‚Äëbyte per transfer, continuous mode, you don‚Äôt have functional issues now.
Remaining points are either style/robustness or future‚Äëproofing if you expand to bursts, multiple bytes per trigger, or additional modes.



If you like, I can extend your FSM to support multi-byte bursts with the same continuous trigger behaviour ‚Äî that would eliminate the hardcoded stop numbers (1 and 3) and make this design burst‚Äëlength agnostic without breaking current operation.  


Do you want me to prepare that upgraded FSM plan?
